🔍 Exploring Unsupervised Learning with K-means Clustering 🔍
I've been diving into unsupervised learning and recently experimented with the K-means clustering algorithm. 🧩 This powerful method helps in grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities, without any prior labels. In my example, I generated synthetic data and successfully identified distinct clusters, visualizing the results with clear boundaries. It's impressive to see how machine learning can uncover hidden patterns and structures in data! 🚀
